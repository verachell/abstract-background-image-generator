Generates abstract images of user-defined dimensions. Installation instructions and example images shown.

Still working on the README, to be updated soon.

## Installation
This shell script uses the fish shell. It will not work with bash or any other shell. The fish shell is easy to install and works out of the box. For Debian-based Linux systems such as Ubuntu, you can install fish via the synaptic package manager. For other distros, see [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) for more info on installation.
