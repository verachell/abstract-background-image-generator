# abstract-background-image-generator
Generates abstract images of user-defined dimensions. Installation instructions and example images shown.

Still working on the README, to be updated soon.

## Installation
This shell script uses the fish shell v 3.0.2. The script will not work with bash or any other shell, or with previous versions of fish (due to the usage of the 'random' function). The fish shell is easy to install and works out of the box. 
- For Debian-based Linux systems such as Ubuntu, you can install fish via the synaptic package manager. 
- For other distros, see [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) for more info on installation.

This script also uses the imagemagick package, which is by default installed on most mainstream Linux distros. I suggest
